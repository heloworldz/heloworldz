👋 Hi, I'm David V Aye

I’m an MCA graduate passionate about Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, and Full-Stack Development.
I enjoy working on projects that combine network security, data protection, and AI-powered solutions.
I have hands-on experience with Python, Machine Learning, Streamlit, Dash, and MIT App Inventor, and I actively explore cybersecurity tools like Nmap and Wireshark.
Currently, I’m:
Expanding my knowledge in ethical hacking & penetration testing (TryHackMe, HackTheBox).
Building AI-powered applications (chatbots, sentiment analysis, dashboards).
Exploring real-time data visualization and smart app development.
